      "Il primo maggio 2015 il nostro Consorzio TerroirMarche ha compiuto 2 anni.\n",
      "Nato quasi per caso in un lungo viaggio comunitario a Montpellier, quello che sembrava un piccolo sogno è diventato una bella realtà: un luogo di aggregazione di vignaioli bio che condividono idee e pratiche per difendere e valorizzare il proprio \"terroir\". Banale a dirsi, impresa titanica a farsi - in una regione come la nostra dove fra campanili vecchi e nuovi, politica e politici vecchi e nuovi, consorterie e maneggi vecchi e nuovi, vere e proprie sperimentazioni \"dal basso\" è difficile farle crescere, specie nel mondo dell'agricoltura.\n",

      "Non sarà infatti la solita fiera del vino più o meno naturale.\n",
      "Sarà una cosa nuova e diversa perché per la prima volta sono i vignaioli stessi, senza l'intermediazione di associazioni o proloco o amministrazioni o distributori o organizzatori di eventi, a rischiare del loro ed a impegnarsi in prima persona per questo evento.\n",
      "Sarà una cosa nuova e diversa perché accanto ai classici banchi di assaggio ci saranno 5 importanti laboratori dove si proveranno a capire i perché e i percome dei nostri vini: troppo spesso nella comunicazione si danno per scontate questioni che in realtà non lo sono, come l'identità, l'autenticità, il reale peso specifico dei vini di un determinato territorio.\n",

      "Di nuovo al Vinitaly\n",
      "Fra poco prenderò la strada di Verona per partecipare al ViViT. Non lo faccio con grande piacere, certamente. Le alternative non mancavano. E dunque mi piace spendere qualche parole sulle ragioni di questa scelta.\n",
      "Avevo partecipato alla grande kermesse veronese in uno stand della Regione Marche nel 2002, proprio all'inizio della mia esperienza di vignaiolo. Poi dal 2004 il luogo veronese per me è stato, per molti anni, il centro sociale La Chimica dentro quel laboratorio che fu Critical Wine. Il centro sociale è stato sgomberato dal Sindaco Sceriffo Tosi, così nel 2010 e 2011 ho esposto a Cerea in quel di ViniVeri. Posto splendido e compagnia davvero bella. Poi un anno sabbatico ed un anno lontano da Verona, l'anno scorso, a tentare di riflettere su cosa sia diventato questo nostro variegato movimento dei vignaioli naturali...\n",
      "Nel frattempo è nato terroirMarche e con i compagni del Consorzio, con i quali abbiamo partecipato a Millésime BIO a Montpellier e a Vignaioli Naturali a Roma, si è fatta strada l'idea di aderire come Consorzio marchigiano al salone ViViT. E' con loro che sono nate una serie di considerazioni sullo stato dell'arte. Da un lato c'era e c'è l'idea della grande potenzialità di Cerea come spazio per una grande fiera unitaria e alternativa di tutto il naturale. Dall'altro il dato di realtà è che quella potenzialità, a causa di divisioni, protagonismi, contraddizioni ma anche legittime scelte da parte di soggetti e associazioni, resta tuttora secondo noi in grande parte inespressa.\n",
      "A questo si aggiunge un dato incontrovertibile, soprattutto dopo l'entrata di FederBio a gamba tesa con l'organizzazione del VinitalyBIO: oramai a Verona fra vini senza solfiti, proposte più o meno sostenibili e vini più o meno \"liberi\", comincia ad aver senso il fatto di presidiare una zona dove poter presentare certi percorsi davvero autentici. Perché alla fine a Villa Favorita ed a Cerea va veramente solo chi già conosce ed apprezza certi vini, mentre a Vinitaly volenti o nolenti vanno proprio tutti.\n",
      "Ecco quindi che oggigiorno, con la comunicazione distorta che sta passando sul \"vino naturale\", l'impressione è che - senza ViViT - un generico operatore del mondovino camminando dentro Vinitaly possa pensare che Cotarella, Farinetti o l'azienda che resta nei soli limiti del disciplinare Bio presente negli spazi FederBIO facciano \"vini naturali\".\n",
      "Insomma, ci stanno fregando.\n",
      "E non a caso la mia contrarietà al ViViT non era mai stata nei confronti dell'operazione in sé ma verso i modi con i quali si era concretizzata: cioé senza nessuno percorso \"politico\". Quanto fosse necessario lo misuriamo oggi, quando non passa giorno senza che avvengano ipocrite sussunzioni del \"vero\", del \"naturale\", del \"buono, pulito e giusto\".\n",
      "Dunque quest'anno va così. Poi vedremo. Il ritorno di Renaissance a Cerea dimostra che la coerenza non è di questo mondo. E forse per chi è \"movimento\" è anche giusto sia così.\n",

      "Reduce da una due giorni romana all'insegna del grande cinema (a proposito: L'emploi du temp di Cantet e Sunday di Nossiter sono due film eccezionali) e del vino naturale, resta una riflessione di fondo sul valore di queste commistioni: come vignaioli artigiani stiamo sfruttando ancora poco il gigantesco potenziale insito nei nostri vini e nel nostro lavoro.\n",
      "Sta emergendo chiaramente negli ultimi anni come il nostro atto creativo sia un atto eminentemente culturale - forse non artistico come mi ha fatto notare Giovanni Bietti - ma certamente culturale (nell'accezione più moderna del termine \"cultura\"). Ma se è così, il confronto nell'ambito della cultura e dei suoi circuiti, deve divenire sempre di più il nostro obiettivo, la nostra missione. Come scrivevo recentemente (qui), dovremmo davvero rivoluzionare il modo con cui organizziamo i nostri saloni e cercare quanto più possibile la contaminazione con altre forme di cultura: il cinema, come sta facendo benissimo Jonathan Nossiter, ma anche la musica, la letteratura, la poesia. Immaginando laboratori innovativi e coinvolgenti che possano creare circuiti virtuosi, anche commercialmente, e che possano svecchiare definitivamente il mondo dell'agricoltura, rendendolo sempre più protagonista di una vera e propria rinascita.\n",

      "Ricordate la polemica dell'anno scorso fra La Terra Trema, l'ormai classico appuntamento del Leonkavallo, e Semplicemente Uva, quella che doveva essere la \"nuova\" fiera dei vini naturali a Milano? Ne scrissi qui. Se ne parlò a lungo e \"noi\" produttori CriticalWine lavorammo ad un documento che spiegava la nostra posizione sulla faccenda. Nel polemicone finì anche Porthos che, di fatto, venne chiamata a riempire di contenuti una fiera altrimenti triste ed inutile.\n",
      "Ad un anno di distanza La Terra Trema ha avuto il successo di sempre (purtroppo non ho partecipato causa mio \"anno sabbatico\"), mentre la seconda edizione di Semplicemente Uva sembra rinviata (queste le ragioni addotte: Si informa che per motivi indipendenti dalla volontà degli organizzatori e relativi ad opere di ristrutturazione della location prescelta, la manifestazione SEMPLICEMENTEUVA è rimandata a febbraio 2012 in data da definire).\n",
      "Nel frattempo Maurizio Silvestri ha pubblicato un pezzo su Porthos.it che mi è molto piaciuto e che vi invito a leggere qui. Non so se è un ripensamento rispetto alla polemica dell'anno scorso e non mi interessa. E' un bel pezzo. Che fotografa ciò che l'appuntamento di Milano rappresenta: un atto di resistenza creativa; un rito liberatorio; una grande festa. Alla faccia dei sempre più tristi appuntamenti \"cosiddetti\" naturali.\n",

      "L'implosione dell'avaguardia naturale denunciata con grande anticipo da Porthos (salvo poi contribuire ad uno dei colpi finali) arriva al suo apice, con una mail anonima, un'idea un pò strampalata (fermare lo spazio in attesa di vedere le reazioni/adesioni), una totale assenza di partecipazione e di progetto, gli imbarazzati silenzi e i commenti fuori luogo degli altri protagonisti della vicenda (Vini veri e VinNatur), le richieste di partecipazione che iniziano già ad arrivare, a otto o nove mesi dagli eventi in questione. Una follia.\n",
      "Quindi niente Fornovo, niente Leoncavallo, niente mercato FIVI, niente Roma, niente Agazzano, niente Cerea, niente Vinitaly. Serve una pausa. Una riflessione sui semi che sono stati lanciati e su come siano germogliati. Su chi siamo e su quello che vorremmo essere. Certamente questa riflessione è stata fatta, e bene, dentro contenitori come La Terra trema e GustoNudo (non a caso derivazioni del vecchio Critical Wine) e sarebbe logico continuare a partecipare perlomeno a queste esperienze. In realtà, però, c'è anche da parte mia una certa stanchezza dopo almeno otto anni di giri per fiere e mercati. Sento veramente l'esigenza di una pausa, anche per capire fino in fondo il senso dei molti discorsi affrontati negli ultimi anni e capire la strada da percorrere nel prossimo futuro.\n",

      "L'ex prima industria del sistema Italia\n",
      "Fra i tanti problemi che ha questo nostro paese, intesa come comunità nazionale che il prossimo 17 marzo festeggerà un'importante quanto controversa ricorrenza, c'è l'ormai totale discrepanza fra le parole ed i fatti. Viviamo, cioé, in una realtà parallela dove tutti possono dire la loro senza alcun riscontro statistico o fattuale che possa confermare o meno certe affermazioni. E' il frutto di una società da un lato troppo e male mediatizzata (nel senso che i media - tutti, senza esclusione - invece di fotografare la realtà la manipolano); dall'altro di una caratteristica tutta italiana che è riassumibile nella frase: \"...tanto poi tutto s'aggiusta...\". Anche i numeri.\n",
      "Questa banale premessa per parlare di turismo. Chi - in piccolo o in grande - ha avuto a che fare con il settore turistico nel nostro paese sa bene che gli ultimi anni non sono stati facili. C'è una crisi generalizzata nel settore che coinvolge tutti: alberghi, bed&breakfast, agriturismi, resort, campeggi. A parte il fatto che il sistema-Italia è arretrato pesantemente nel mondo, tanto da non essere più il nostro paese una meta fra le più ambite dai turisti, c'è un enorme problema legato al turismo interno: gli italiani viaggiano meno in generale ma se viaggiano scelgono sempre meno il proprio paese.\n",
      "Eppure alla recente fiera BIT di Milano si sono come sempre suonate le campane a festa. E' una situazione che ricorda un pò il settore del vino, dove da diverso tempo si nega la crisi ed anzi si gioisce per l'aumento dell'export. Dimenticando che nel 1970 la media del consumo di vino in Italia era di 114 litri pro-capite mentre oggi è 40 litri pro-capite.\n",
      "Questa scelta di privilegiare nelle politiche pubbliche il mercato estero, che è solo in minima parte legata alla globalizzazione, accomuna sia il settore vinicolo che quello turistico, col risultato di finire proprio nella tana del lupo, ovvero dentro ai mercati più competitivi e difficili.\n",
      "Ecco, per farla breve consiglio l'articolo \"turismo senza sorrisi\" sul portale lavoce.info, dove è possibile trovare qualche numero e pure una equlibrata analisi.\n",

      "Per chiarire il concetto\n",
      "Visto che il mio ultimo post \"si è fatto sentire\" e che a La Terra Trema si discute dei \"Cosiddetti\", posto un contributo che avevo scritto (con l'editing di A. Morichetti che ringrazio) per Intravino sette mesi fa e che pare \"profetico\" (non certo perché lo abbia scritto io bensì perché è la questione ad essere centrale). Di fatto la questione è:\n",
      "1) Se la mettiamo solo sul piano delle sostanze che possono finire in un vino nel giro di qualche anno l'industria replicherà in laboratorio i vini \"naturali\" e ci sbatterà fuori dal mercato.\n",
      "2) Se noi vignaioli continuiamo a dividerci e a fare percorsi differenti siamo più deboli.\n",
      "3) Come diceva Gino: La terra, la terra, all'infinito la Terra.\n",
      "Il vicolo cieco\n",
      "Forse non tutti sanno che” sarebbe un inizio niente male. Sentite che bel titolo ha questa recente ricerca dell’Università di Sassari: “Individuazione di ceppi di Saccharomyces cerevisiae medio-basso produttori di etanolo” . Traduco in italiano lo scopo: isolare lieviti da vino che producano poco alcol. Curioso, no?Ricordo male io o fino a ieri l’altro la ricerca microbiologica faceva l’esatto contrario – cioé selezionare ceppi in grado di garantire una più elevata resa alcolica? Partiamo da qui per continuare la discussione iniziata con alcuni interessanti articoli di Intravino.\n",
      "Leggendo tra le righe, la ricerca menzionata ci comunica qualcosa di importante. In ambito agronomico ed enologico si tende continuamente a sperimentare tecniche, tecnologie e prassi in grado di seguire il Mercato. Oggi il Mercato chiede vini più “leggeri”? Messaggio ricevuto, il “sistema-vino” si adegua. Come ieri si era adeguato ai vini-frutto. Purtroppo, ho la brutta sensazione che la discussione sui “vini naturali” stia prendendo la stessa piega. Oramai si parla apertamente di moda, le fiere ed i saloni alternativi riscuotono successo e i produttori di questa nicchia paiono risentire meno della crisi rispetto ai “convenzionali”. Si arriva ad ipotizzare un padiglione comune al prossimo Vinitaly.\n",
      "Sarà mica che il percorso “naturale” sta finendo in un pericoloso vicolo cieco? Quando ci si relaziona al vino naturale adottando le medesime modalità con cui si era cavalcata l’onda modernista del vino-frutto, il rischio è serio e non possiamo negarlo. Quando la bottiglia di vino naturale diventa merce esattamente come fu il Supertuscan costruito in laboratorio con vitigni pompati, la deriva commerciale e mediatica è dietro l’angolo. Sono solo cambiate le parole d’ordine: il vino non deve più essere morbido, opulento e fruttoso bensì “sano”, genericamente “eco-compatibile” e magari “misterioso” o comunque bioqualcosa. Concordo con Porthos quando parla di implosione dell’avanguardia naturale.\n",
      "Fare vino seguendo le (presunte) richieste del mercato significa negare l’essenza del movimento “naturale”, che sintetizzo in 3 punti: critica radicale al modo con cui oggi l’umanità si relaziona alla natura, visione totalmente alternativa dell’agricoltura, lotta ai processi socio-economici dominanti. Oggi è impossibile parlare di “vino naturale” senza affrontare i nodi legati al sistema industriale di produzione, accumulazione e commercio ma soprattutto senza un approccio organico – che partendo dal vignaiolo arriva fino al consumatore, inteso come co-produttore (termine figlio della riflessione di Terra e Libertà/Critical Wine). È altrettanto necessario contestualizzare vino, cibo e agricoltura in orizzonti socio-culturali irriducibili ad una certa idea di Mercato. Valutare i “vini naturali” solo in base a caratteristiche sensoriali è limitante e ingeneroso nei confronti di chi da anni lavora ad un’idea integralmente diversa del vino e, oserei dire, della vita stessa.\n",
      "Stiamo assistendo a un fenomeno enorme, cioé al totale sovvertimento del paradigma agronomico-enologico cui si era approdati negli anni ‘80/’90. Questo grazie agli studi di Claude e Lydia Bourguignon e di Jules Chauvet, grazie ai testi classici della biodinamica, antichi e moderni (Rudolf Steiner, Ehrenfried E. Pfeiffer, Alex Podolinsky, Nicholas Joly), e alle prassi dei pionieri del vino naturale (Lapierre, Overnoy, Breton, Binner, ecc). E il fermento è tutt’altro che terminato.\n",
      "In questo contesto è stato meno appariscente, ma non meno rilevante, il cambio di approccio in termini di vendita e commercializzazione. Si ricorre sempre meno a grandi distribuzioni, grandi agenzie di rappresentanza e catene commerciali, ma sempre di più al rapporto diretto col co-produttore (attraverso vendita diretta, fiere, gruppi di acquisto) o con piccoli operatori specializzati, locali ed esteri. Diventano centrali un approccio differente al settore agricolo e l’interazione tra vignaiolo – artigiano/artista – e consumatore finale. Nella bottiglia di vino naturale, così come in un’opera d’arte, si cercano magia e piacere estetico, materiale ed intellettuale, dove il bello e il buono divengono fenomeno culturale e presidio etico. Altro che merce. Altro che banale e brutale bene di consumo. Altro che status symbol.\n",
      "Se tutto ciò è vero – e può benissimo non esserlo – apparirà chiaro quanto sia delicata e complessa la questione dell’eventuale partecipazione del “movimento dei vini naturali” al Vinitaly. Personalmente, non sono nemmeno contrario per principio e non rinnego la mia passata partecipazione. Credo però che una scelta simile possa avere un senso solo in quanto gesto politico di rottura rispetto alle problematiche odierne in agricoltura: la sovrapproduzione, denominazioni di origine, certificazioni, burocrazia, uso sfrenato di chimica e tecnologia, standardizzazione del gusto e via dicendo. Dubito che allo stadio attuale il movimento naturale abbia la forza di proporsi compatto con un’identità forte e determinata. Dubito inoltre che il Sistema-vino – rappresentato dal Vinitaly – abbia davvero interesse ad accogliere dentro al “palazzo” il dissenso e l’alternativa. Temo, invece, che le sirene del marketing e dell’industria stiano già lavorando per concentrarsi su nuove forme e nuove apparenze, tralasciando ancora una volta la sostanza.\n",

      "E' questa la riflessione che nasce in me dalla manifestazione Semplicemente Uva, fiera del vino \"cosiddetto\" naturale organizzata dal \"gastronauta\" Davide Paolini, che si svolgerà a Milano in concomitanza - guarda caso - dell'annuale appuntamento al Leoncavallo (La Terra Trema).\n",
      "Sono stato contattato mesi fa da una società che - immagino - è stata incaricata di organizzare l'evento. Comunicazione ultra markettara, messaggi poco chiari, sovrapposizione con l'appuntamento ex-critical wine. Varie ragioni mi hanno fatto declinare l'invito, nonostante una certa, pressante, richiesta.\n",
      "Bene. Oggi ricevo dagli splendidi ragazzi organizzatori da anni, con sbattimenti notevoli, della rassegna leoncavallina un comunicato che potete leggere qui di seguito. Inutile aggiungere che lo sottoscrivo in pieno. Spiace un pò che questa deriva coinvolga anche persone che stimo...\n",

      "La questione riguarda una manifestazione – nuova - che si svolge contemporaneamente alla nostra: Semplicemente Uva, organizzata da Davide Paolini.\n",
      "Il sovrapporsi con altri eventi non è mai stato un problema per noi, è capitato altre volte e La Terra Trema non impone, né pretende alcun tipo di monopolio, anzi si augura che le economie dei vignaioli girino e bene.\n",
      "Per questo motivo, quando ci hanno segnalato questa “fortuita coincidenza” non abbiamo dato troppo peso, abbiamo detto “si vedrà, aspettiamo di capire”.\n",
      "La struttura comunicativa della suddetta manifestazione, sito e comunicati stampa, non aiutavano a capire però; per lungo tempo, avari di informazioni, non spiegavano né chi, né come, né perché.\n",
      "Le cose sono emerse piano e con chiarezza solo pochi giorni fa, per merito dei vignaioli che - da parecchi anni - con La Terra Trema collaborano, ragionano, reagiscono.\n",
      "In tanti hanno chiamato. E i racconti che ci riportavano rasentavano l’intimidazione mafiosa: vignaioli che, in nome del vino “cosiddetto naturale” si trovavano costretti a partecipare all’evento, a rinunciare alla partecipazione a La Terra Trema, un ricatto che arriva ritornava in modo prepotente anche da agenti e distributori.\n",
      "Lo diciamo da un pezzo: le teorie del “buono, pulito e giusto”, del biologico naturale, sincero e semplice, da sole, non bastano e rischiano di diventare la miglior foglia di fico per nascondere ambigui interessi privati, economie balorde.\n",
      "La Terra Trema lavora da molti anni perché le economie del vino (e delle agricolture in generale) girino intorno a chi le mani le sporca a fondo, nella terra, tra le foglie e i grappoli e non intorno a chi fa giusto lo sforzo di aggrapparsi a un telefono e chiamare e intimidire, minacciare ed escogitare deliranti ricatti.\n",
      "Manifestazioni come Semplicemente Uva sono per noi l’esempio schietto di un mercato degenerato, malato e marcio, che - sfacciatamente - serve e protegge solo le solite lobbies.\n",
      "Per questo motivo abbiamo deciso di imporre - per la prima volta - il nostro out out a quei produttori (pochissimi a dire il vero, giusto 2/3) che hanno aderito ad entrambi gli eventi; questo passaggio per noi si rende obbligatorio perché se per i vignaioli che partecipano a La Terra Trema non è chiaro il nostro tipo di discorso un progetto come La Terra Trema non ha motivo d’essere.\n",
      "A onor del vero i produttori in questione hanno ritenuto di disdire la loro partecipazione a Su per partecipare a LTT, comprendendo a pieno le motivazioni che ci hanno portato a chiamarli.\n",

      "E c'è chi, invece, con molta buona volontà ed ottimi risultati cerca di tracciarne un profilo. E' il caso di Giovanni Bietti che ha presentato, proprio a Cerea, il suo manuale. Non una guida ma una \"cassetta degli attrezzi\" ad uso di consumatori ed appassionati, per fare un pò di chiarezza sulla spinosa questione.\n",
      "L'importanza del volume è innanzitutto teorica. Il fatto che ora esista un manuale sui vini naturali (qualche volume in francese già c'era, per la verità) sgombera il campo dal primo grande equivoco, quello cavalcato da chi sostiene che \"i vini naturali non esistono\" (esisterebbe solo l'aceto). No, il vino naturale esiste. Ed è definito secondo alcuni criteri molto bene esposti.\n",
      "In secondo luogo questo primo volume, dedicato al centro Italia, oltre a presentare alcuni dei protagonisti di questo mondo, è importante perché affronta di petto alcune questioni essenziali: gli additivi enologici, la questione della solforosa, l'aspetto centrale della digeribilità e bevibilità dei vini naturali.\n",
      "Ma allora dove va il movimento dei vini naturali? C'è chi dice dentro a Vinitaly. Non so. La voce girava già lo scorso anno. Ne avevo anche scritto. Non sarei contrario a priori, a patto di riuscire prima a trovare un terreno comune, una identità condivisa, un percorso unitario (pur con tutte le legittime diversità di vedute).\n",
      "A parte le divisioni in gruppi ed associazioni, si assiste ad una fastidiosa reclusione autoreferenziale dentro un recinto. C'è indubbiamente la corsa ad auto-proclamarsi \"quelli bravi\". C'è anche sicuramente qualche spinta un pò fighetta verso una dorata, e pericolosa, torre d'avorio. Non credo, però, che partecipare a Vinitaly sia \"La\" soluzione. Anzi. La sistemazione di quest'anno mi è parsa molto bella, funzionale, attraente. Ed anche con notevoli potenzialità di espansione, se questa fosse la volontà.\n",
      "Quello che so è che i vini presenti a queste fiere sono sempre più buoni. Di VinoVinoVino2010 faccio solo alcuni nomi: il veracissimo Chianti Le trame 2007 di Giovanna Morganti; i vini finissimi di Cascina delle Rose, in particolare mi ha colpito il Barbaresco Tre Stelle 2007; lo stupendo Le vieux clos 2006 di Nicolas Joly, salino, dominato da sentori elegantissimi di frutti di mare; il bevibilissimo Morgon 2007 di Foillard; tutti i borgogna bianchi di Pierre Morey; tutti i vini di Beppe Rinaldi.\n",
      "Il futuro non si sa. Non so se correrò un'altra maratona, ad esempio. Bene a Milano, tutto sommato. Considerando l'allenamento risicato, i tre giorni di fiera, il freddo al via ed il vento contrario per buona parte della gara. Ho chiuso in 3h54m51s cioé un minuto sotto il mio personale. La sensazione era, ed è, che avrei potuto fare decisamente meglio se non mi fosse venuto un dolore al ginocchio sinistro già intorno al 13 km. Ho cercato di gestire al meglio la corsa e il dolore. Ovviamente, però, l'azione e la postura ne hanno risentito. Poi, al 39°, si è spenta la luce ed arrivare è stato veramente molto difficile.\n",
      "Lasciar perdere sapendo di potersi migliorare ancora è dura. Ma l'impegno di una corsa del genere è davvero davvero molto grande.\n",

      "I nuovi fenomeni\n",
      "L'altro giorno chiacchieravo di vino col mio amico Guido Galli, enotecario in Senigallia. A un certo punto Guido se ne esce con la definizione \"nuovi fenomeni\", parlando dei nuovi sboroni del vino. E mi sono accorto che finalmente avevo trovato quello che cercavo: la definizione per i tanti personaggi che ultimamente affollano i banchi degustazioni delle fiere e i tanti spazi virtuali di discussione (blog, forum, social network, ecc.). Perché i fenomeni son sempre esistiti, ma ora siamo alla evoluzione della specie. Dai basici \"Fa legno?\" o \"Questo vino ha fatto la malolattica\" o \"No, rosso no, sto facendo il giro dei bianchi\" siamo passati a ben altre argomentazioni, a ben altre sovrastrutture.\n",
      "I nuovi fenomeni riconoscono il tipo di rovere. I nuovi fenomeni sanno perfettamente quale ceppo di lievito ha svolto gli zuccheri. I nuovi fenomeni sanno precisamente quanti giorni ha macerato sulle bucce il vino. I nuovi fenomeni, in virtù dei molteplici corsi e seminari che hanno frequentato e delle decine di manifestazioni dove bazzicano ogni anno, riconoscono centinaia di sentori ed aromi, incensano i vini estremi ma odiano l'acidità volatile, cercano in continuazione le nuove \"chicche\" enologiche ma poi si gasano coi vini blasonati, maneggiano i concetti della biodinamica e ricordano benissimo l'andamento stagionale in Borgogna, Cote de Nuits, nel 1997.\n",
      "Inutile dire che per noi produttori avere a che fare coi nuovi fenomeni è un piacevole inferno. Si impara sempre qualcosa. Arriverà il tempo in cui riceveremo regolari fatture per le consulenze prestate. D'altronde è ciò che fa il capostipite dei nuovi fenomeni, no?\n",

      "Quando si parla di evoluzione della stampa 3d al giorno d’oggi parliamo soprattutto del filamento 3d utilizzato  per la stampa 3D.Le stampanti si stanno evolvendo, ma gli incrementi sono sempre più modesti; tutto ciò accade non per il raggiungimento dei limiti fisici, ma di quelli chimici; è per questo motivo che quando si parla delle grandi evoluzioni della stampa 3D nel presente (come nel prossimo futuro), si parla di filamenti disponibili.\n",
      "I filamenti fanno parte delle innovazioni che stanno progredendo maggiormente in questo momento!\n",
      "Qui vogliamo elencare i filamenti a disposizione per far lavorare la vostra creatività.\n",
      "I due filamenti più utilizzati e discussi.\n",
      "Diamo uno sguardo ai due filamenti più utilizzati: ABS e PLA. Probabilmente avete sentito parlare di ciascuno di essi e normalmente si acquista una stampante ben sapendo se è stata progettata per la stampa di entrambi o solo uno dei due filamenti. Quali sono le differenze tra questi materiali termoplastici?\n",
      "ABS\n",
      "ABS è l’abbreviazione di acrilonitrile-butadiene-stirene. E’ ampiamente disponibile ed è stata una plastica molto popolare nello sviluppo della stampa 3D fino dai primi tempi . Si scioglie costantemente a circa 225 gradi Celsius, che sono facilmente ottenibili con piccole stampanti. È relativamente forte, leggermente flessibile ed ha una “temperatura di transizione vetrosa” piuttosto alta: circa 100 gradi.\n",
      "Questa è la temperatura oltre la quale una plastica va stato solido a uno stato flessibile in cui può perdere la sua forma. Queste caratteristiche fanno si che l’ABS sia un materiale molto adatto alla stampa 3D di parti funzionali, come pezzi di ricambio per le macchine o oggetti che sono esposti a temperature elevate, che stazionano sotto la luce del sole o a contatto con l’acqua calda.\n",
      "ABS è solubile in acetone e questa caratteristica è talvolta sfruttata per lisciare la superficie della stampa.  Se la stampa viene carteggiata e poi trattata con acetone si scioglie lo strato esterno, che essenzialmente liscerà l’oggetto riducendo la visibilità dei layer di stampa. La lavorazione con vapori di acetone merita in pieno l’etichetta “non provateci a casa”, ma il non usarlo ci precluderà la possibilità di avere stampe liscie.\n",
      "Aspetti negativi\n",
      "Gli aspetti negativi dell’ABS sono: l’odore che produce mentre viene riscaldato – che non è né buono né sano – (pensate che recenti studi hanno paragonato l’esposizione da odori di stampa di ABS al fumo, chi è esposto giornalmente a questi gas può essere considerato con gli stessi rischi di un fumatore), l’ABS poi non deve tassativamente essere usato per la produzione di oggetti atti a contenere o trattare il cibo: è stato ampiamente dimostrato che la plastica interagisce con gli alimenti (soprattutto in fase di riscaldamento) cedendo molecole, alcune anche molto pericolose per la salute se ingerite, quali per esempio il BPA (Bisfenolo A), presente peraltro in quasi tutti i tipi di plastica.\n",
      "Un altro aspetto negativo è che l’ABS è soggetto a forte  espansione e ritrazione in procinto di essere riscaldato e ri-raffreddato. Il ritiro, in particolare, è un problema per la stampa 3D, perché provoca il restringimento delle stampe che, se vengono raffreddate troppo in fretta, possono subire una grave deformazione. Per contrastare questo fenomeno, l’ABS deve essere stampato su un piatto riscaldato e preferibilmente con una stampante chiusa, così da rimane calda durante la stampa e mitigando il raffreddamento, rendendolo più lento.\n",
      "Un piatto riscaldato e la “camera chiusa” di solito aumentano il prezzo di una stampante 3D e fa si che venga utilizzata molta più elettricità.\n",
      "ABS ad effetti speciali\n",
      "ABS è generalmente disponibile in meno colori rispetto PLA, ma qualcuno potrebbe essere interessante.\n",
      "Questo ABS sensibile alla temperatura, che cambia colore al cambiare di temperatura.\n",
      "Disponibile in Blu->bianco, viola->rosa e grigio->bianco\n",
      "Disponibile da 3D2print: http://shop.sdm3d.it/en/plug-and-play/49-sdm-3d2-pro-3d-printer-fdm-fff.html\n",
      "Smart ABS\n",
      "Non ci sono molti particolari tipi di ABS, ma ABS intelligenti si (anche noto come Pro ABS)\n",
      "Questa particolare formula offre una migliore adesione tra gi strati e circa il 30% in meno di ritiro causa delle deformazioni. Il Pro ABS è utilizzato principalmente per le parti funzionali, quindi la gamma cromatica è limitata, è disponibile a questo link:\n",
      "http://shop.sdm3d.it/en/plug-and-play/49-sdm-3d2-pro-3d-printer-fdm-fff.html\n",
      "ABS Pieghevole\n",
      "Quando si tratta di flessibilità, questo materiale si trova da qualche parte nel mezzo tra l’ABS classico e il filamento flessibile (ne parleremo più sotto). “Bendlay”, è il suo nome e sembra essere un ABS modificato che è sia chiaro e molto pieghevole. Si dice di essere il 200% più pieghevole rispetto all’ABS e non genera le smagliature da sforzo bianche mentre viene piegato.\n",
      "Il Bendlay è acquistabile a questo indirizzo:\n",
      "http://shop.sdm3d.it/en/plug-and-play/49-sdm-3d2-pro-3d-printer-fdm-fff.html\n",
      "PLA\n",
      "PLA-o acido polilattico è un tipo completamente diverso di materiale termoplastico. E’ composto da amido di mais o canna da zucchero ed è biodegradabile, è più rispettoso dell’ambiente rispetto all’ABS. Normalmente si può fondere ad una temperatura più bassa dei filamenti derivati da petrolio, tra i 190 e 210 gradi e non fa cattivo odore durante lo scioglimento.\n",
      "Poiché il PLA scorre un po ‘meglio dell’ ABS è possibile stampare oggetti più dettagliati e a velocità più elevate. E ‘particolarmente adatto a produrre spigoli vivi.\n",
      "Il PLA è molto meno soggetto alla deformazione, per cui non richiede necessariamente un letto di stampa riscaldato, tuttavia se si desidera stampare oggetti di grande dimensione un po’ di calore (circa 60 gradi) non guasta . Le stampe hanno una superficie relativamente lucida rispetto all’ABS, ma la quantità di lucidità dipende dalla temperatura di estrusione oltre che dalle caratteristiche intrinseche del filamento usato.\n",
      "Caratteristiche\n",
      "Il PLA non è solubile in acetone, può essere sciolto in idrossido di sodio (soda caustica). Ricordiamo che la soda caustica è un materiale molto pericoloso e va maneggiato con particolare attenzione, può creare gravi ustioni a contatto con la pelle. Noi raccomandiamo l’uso di soda caustica solo in caso di otturazione dell’estrusore, non liberabile altrimenti.\n",
      "Un modo più sicuro per “lucidare” le stampe è quello di usare una pistola ad aria calda sverniciatrice, la temperatura elevata (fino a 400°) farà sciogliere lo strato superficiale e omogeneizzerà la superficie, facendo sparire gli scalini lasciati dalla sovrapposizione dei layers; Anche questo processo merita attenzione, l’oggetto sovraesposto a calore potrebbe rovinarsi velocemente, ovviamente è necessaria un po’ di pratica.\n",
      "Alcune persone usano il PLA come supporti solubili per le stampe su ABS stampanti a doppia estrusione.\n",
      "Il PLA è disponibile anche ampiamente ed è semplicemente più facile da stampare, quindi la conclusione è che il PLA è attualmente la migliore soluzione per stampe “standard” da casa e ufficio nonostante la recente introduzione di filamenti “Next Gen” che stanno cercando di rubargli questo primato.\n",
